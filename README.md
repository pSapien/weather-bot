## HOW TO USE

1. Make sure you have your own `openweathermap` API key.
2. Once, you have your keys, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and put your key there.
3. Now, you could run through the terminal.

Get inside the project folder inside your favorite terminal and run :-

```
yarn start
```

## EXAMPLE

After running `yarn start` on the terminal. You could run following commands like
```
> Hello.
> What's the weather like in kathmandu?
> Bye
```

The bot is as dumb as it gets.
It is made by using `pattern matching`.
Don't expect much.
NO NLP shenanigans here.
